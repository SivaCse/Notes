# Call Stack

Call stack is the datastructure, used by javascript engines  to keep functions what functions are called from, within that function and should be called next.

* When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
* Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
* When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
